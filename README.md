    cer and Consumer pattern with wait, notifyAll.
	* StringDateEx: memory use for String;String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder; five problems of deal with String methods.

2. project
	* CustomerInfoManager:

	a small app simulate the customer information management.

	* TeamSchedule

	build a team schedule for a fighting game (refer to atguigu proj3). Need to be improved:
	1. change Equipment interface to a class. So that we can give the equipment more flexiable for operation: for different attribute, it will contribute to different skills, attack power, etc.
	2. make a superclass for a team (or squad), so that we can build different teams (or squads).
	3. change Warrior attribute "age" to "hp" and "hp" to "attact".
	4. add attribute "speed", "attact", "remedial", "stratergy" to equipment.
